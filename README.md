The repository contains projects from School 21.
The repository contains simple implementations of popular arcade games from the early 70s.

Pong is a table tennisâ€“themed twitch arcade sports video game, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics, manufactured by Atari. Game developed only for two players. It's controlled by buttons A-Z for left player and K-M for the right player. Game was implemented by me in two modes - manual (step-by-step) and interactive. So in manual mode you have to press the Enter to move the racket and ball. In interactive mode the ball moves automatically. The difficulty and speed of the game increase with the score. Game goes to 21 points.

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway. To start the project, you need to prepare a text file with some starting positions of all kinds of figures. Also, project implemented the ability to select the speed. For this, at the beginning of the file, you have to indicate the speed with the number 1-5, where 1 is the slow mode, 5 is the fast mode. If game was looped it will stop after the some number of iterations.

The repository is updated from time to time.
